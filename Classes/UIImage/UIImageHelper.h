 * Scales image to the size, crops to the offset
 * Provide offset based on scaled size, not original size
 *
 * Example:
 * Image is 640x480, scaling to 480x320
 * This will then scale to 480x360
 *
 * If you want to vertically center the image, set the offset to CGPointMake(0.0,-20.0f)
 * Now it will clip the top 20px, and the bottom 20px giving you the desired 480x320
